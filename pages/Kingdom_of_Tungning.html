                        <p>The <b>Kingdom of Tungning</b> was a monarchy on Taiwan between 1661 and 1683. It was established by a warlord named <a href="Zheng_Chenggong.html">Zheng Chenggong</a>, who remained loyal to the Ming Dynasty after it had been overthrown by the <a href="Qing.html">Qing</a>, with the purpose of eventually restoring the Ming Dynasty. Its original name was <i>Tungtu</i>, meaning "Eastern capital", though it was promptly renamed by Zheng Jing to <i>Tungning</i>, literally meaning "Eastern Pacification". It was also known as <i>Tywan</i> to the British, which is where the island's current name comes from.</p>
                        <p>It was established by <a href="Zheng_Chenggong.html">Zheng Chenggong</a> following his successful siege of the Dutch Fort Zeelandia in 1661. After his death in 1662, his son Zheng Jing assumed control of the kingdom with the support of the local elite, despite Zheng Chenggong having ordered to execute him.</p>
                        <p>Zheng Jing's reign lasted from 1662 to 1681 and has been described as "Taiwan's first Golden Age"<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. While per capita production plunged after mass immigration from the mainland, aggregate production still increased. A reason for this was that the VOC prioritised profit, and directed most of its workforce towards producing cash crops such as sugarcane, while the Zheng regime needed to produce great quantities of rice to sustain its population. Their predominant trading partner was Japan, though they facilitated trade with several South-Asian powers, the Spanish-occupied Philippines, and even the English East India Company, which helped temporarily transform Taiwan into a regional economic hub. Trade with the mainland continued, though only illegally in the form of smuggling of mainland silk and porcelain. Since most of Zheng's soldiers and the people fleeing from Fujian were mostly men who had left their families behind, the trafficking of young girls became especially common.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
                        <p>The Dutch system of land ownership remained relatively unaltered, with the state retaining the majority of the land, though allowing the farmers relatively high autonomy. To put the large standing army the Zheng state needed to maintain to use in the time of peace, special military farms were established for soldiers to work on. The <a href="baojia.html"><i>baojia</i></a> system was also first implemented in this era.</p>
                        <p>While Qing-Zheng relations continued to remain hostile. The Qing instituted an economic blockade against Taiwan and evacuated the coastal regions of <a href="Fujian.html">Fujian</a>. The intended aim of the latter was to prevent the local population from lending its support to the Zhengs if they were to invade the mainland. In practice, this led to mass immigration to Taiwan, especially among academics, towards whom the Qing were particularly hostile, which provided Zheng with ample workforce. Aiming to ease tensions, Zheng Jing initiated negotiating surrendering the kingdom and making it become a tributary state, similar to Korea at the time. However, negotiations broke down by 1669 due in part to growing rifts between the sides and the Qing being unwilling to recognise a separate Han Chinese state.</p>
                        <p>After Zheng Jing's death in 1681, his son, Zheng Kezang inherited his throne, and was defeated by Qing admiral Shi Lang shortly after in 1683, placing Taiwan under the jurisdiction of the <a href="Qing.html">Chinese empire</a>.</p>
