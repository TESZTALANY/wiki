                        <p>The <b>Empire of Japan</b> is the predecessor of modern Japan, having collapsed in 1945. It maintained control over Taiwan from 1895, when China ceded it in accordance with the <a href="First_Sino-Japanese_War.html">Treaty of Shimonoseki</a> following Japanese victory, until 1945, after Japanese surrender in World War II.</p>
                        <p>At the time of acquiring Taiwan, Japan under its Meiji government was beyond eager to assert itself as a major Western-style imperialist power. Being the first Japanese colony, Taiwan was to be used to display Japan's economic and military might. Determined to rule the island fiercely and centrally, the Japanese undertook infrastructure developments to alleviate traversibility issues, constructing the first railroad connecting the northern and southern regions, reinforced the <a href="baojia.html"><i>baojia</i></a> system for more efficient local administration, and began the "Japanization" of their subjects.</p>
                        <p>Their more assertive, centralised control over the island, combined with the fact that many of Taiwan's most valuable resources, such as camphor trees, are found exclusively in the high-altitude regions, led to near incessant conflict with the <a href="Taiwanese_indigenous_peoples.html">Austronesian peoples</a>. Special "Austronesian-only" zones were established, and heavy military presence maintained in their vicinities.</p>
                        <p>As Sino-Japanese relations degraded in the early-1900s, the incentive to assimilate the Chinese population into Japanese society increased substantially. People were encouraged to adopt Japanese culture, customs, religion, tradition, food, clothing, even Japanese names. Childern received extensive education in Japanese, some even had the opportunity to study abroad in Japan.</p>
                        <p>Despite early conceptions of an independent "Republic of Taiwan" having began to form following the change in administration and their promptly quenching by the Japanese, the idea prevailed throught the colonioal era. Students studying in Japanese universities founded the Taiwan Culture Society, which they used as a platform to call for greater autonomy and self-determination for the people of Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>While political freedoms remained limited and heavy surveillance endeared throughout Japanese rule, 1935 saw the introduction of self-government measures that granted ///powers beyond advisory/// to the local councils established 15 years prior, and made half the seats ____, while the other half remained appointed by the colonial authorities. By 1935, male citizens 25 years of age or older were elegible to vote in local elections. Turnout rates among the elegible demographic often surpassed 96%. ///Tokyo retained authority, didnt allow island-wide bodies, the elections were not very consequential, but they mattered a lot to the taiwnanese and this was to become relevant later on when struggles for democratic freedoms under ROC///</p>
			            <p>During the Second World War, Taiwan was used as a springboard for southward military expansion, as well as for housing some of the most dreaded POW camps. In Novemner of 1943 meeting in Cairo, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and China's Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek agreed that following imminent Japanese surrender, the China' reward for its efforts would be sovereignty over Taiwan.</p>
